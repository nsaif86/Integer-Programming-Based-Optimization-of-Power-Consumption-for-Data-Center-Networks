# Integer-Programming-Based-Optimization-of-Power-Consumption-for-Data-Center-Networks

This project represents the work in our paper submitted to [Acta Cybernetica Jurnal](https://cyber.bibl.u-szeged.hu/index.php/actcybern/article/view/4335) "Integer Programming Based Optimization of Power Consumption for Data Center Networks",  DOI: [10.14232/actacyb.299115](https://doi.org/10.14232/actacyb.299115), Authors: [Gergely Kov√°sznai](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37569885400); [Mohammed Nsaif](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37089577341).

### In this project, we provide:

- LinGo code of Integer Linear Programming model to optimize the power in Data Center
 - Benchmarks.

See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfyDH6iGQCc), which includes a practical example of running the code at the end. Please, if you find the code useful, cite our work.
